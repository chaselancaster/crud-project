# Californature
___

Californature is a site designed for California residents who love connecting with the outdoors. In California, the weather makes it easy to get outside year round, and we want to encourage others to do just that.

At its core, Californature is a meetup website where a user can sign up and create a nature meetup event that can accept any amount of participants. Our goal is help California nature enthusaists connect with other people just like them. 

Whether it is going for a hike, meeting at your local park, or looking for a killer beach location, Californature makes it easy to do just that.
